# 10041 - Vito's Family

The world-known gangster Vito Deadstone is moving to New York. He has a very big family there, all of them living in Lamafia Avenue. Since he will visit all his relatives very often, he is trying to find a house close to them.

Vito wants to minimize the total distance to all of them and has blackmailed you to write a program that solves his problem.

## Input

The input consists of several test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases.

For each test case you will be given the integer number of relatives $r$ $(0 < r < 500)$ and the street numbers (also integers) $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_i, \ldots, s_r$ where they live $(0 < s_i < 30000)$. Note that several relatives could live in the same street number.

## Output

For each test case your program must write the minimal sum of distances from the optimal Vito’s house to each one of his relatives. The distance between two street numbers $s_i$ and $s_j$ is $d_{ij} = |s_i - s_j|$.

## Sample Input

```

2 2 4
3 2 4 6

## Sample Output

# 中文翻譯

世界知名的黑幫老大 Vito Deadstone 即將搬到紐約。他在那裡有一個非常龐大的家族，所有親戚都住在 Lamafia Avenue 上。由於他會經常拜訪所有親戚，因此他想找一間離他們都很近的房子。

Vito 希望能讓他到所有親戚的**總距離最小**，並且威脅你寫一個程式來解決這個問題。

## 輸入

輸入包含多筆測資。第一行是測資的筆數。

對於每筆測資，會給你一個整數 $r$，表示親戚的人數 $(0 < r < 500)$，以及他們居住的門牌號碼（皆為整數）$s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_i, \ldots, s_r$，其中 $(0 < s_i < 30000)$。請注意，**多位親戚可能住在相同的門牌號碼**。

## 輸出

對於每筆測資，請輸出從 **Vito 最佳房子位置** 到每位親戚的 **最小距離總和**。兩個門牌號碼 $s_i$ 與 $s_j$ 之間的距離定義為：$d_{ij} = |s_i - s_j|$
