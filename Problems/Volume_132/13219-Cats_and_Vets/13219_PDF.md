# 13219 - Cats and Vets

Let there be $M$ vets (veterinarians) and $N$ cats, where each cat has a **different disease**. Let **all possible combinations** of examinations of cats by vets take place. What is the minimum number of gloves needed so that 

- no vet is exposed to any of the cat’s disease 
- and no cat is exposed to a disease that the cat does not already have? 

(where it is assumed that each vet wears a glove on his right hand only)

In this problem, the gloves can be **turned inside out** and even **placed on top of one another** if necessary without any limits on the number of gloves worn together, but **no decontamination of gloves** is permitted.

Note that if a side of the glove touches either another side of a contaminated side of a glove or a cat, then that side of the glove become contaminated.

假設有 $M$ 位獸醫（veterinarians）與 $N$ 隻貓，每一隻貓都患有**不同的疾病**。所有獸醫與貓之間的**所有可能檢查組合**都會發生。請問至少需要多少副手套才能同時滿足以下條件：

- 沒有任何獸醫會暴露於貓的疾病
- 沒有任何貓會接觸到牠原本沒有的疾病

（假設每位獸醫只在**右手**戴一副手套）

在此問題中，**手套可以翻面**，也可以**多副手套疊戴**，且對於同時戴幾副手套沒有任何限制；但是**不允許對手套進行任何去污染（清潔）行為**。

注意：如果手套的某一面接觸到另一個已被污染的手套表面，或一隻貓那麼該手套的該面就會被污染。

## 輸入

輸入包含多筆測資（≤ 10000），每行一筆，每筆包含兩個整數 $M$ 與 $N$ （$M > 0$ 且 $N > 0$，並且皆可用 64 位元無號整數表示）。

## 輸出

對於每筆測資，輸出一行答案。

Let there be m doctors and n<=m patients, and let all mn possible combinations of examinations of patients by doctors take place. Then what is the minimum number of surgical gloves needed G(m,n) so that no doctor must wear a glove contaminated by a patient and no patient is exposed to a glove worn by another doctor (where it is assumed that each doctor wears a glove on a single hand only)? In this problem, the gloves can be turned inside out and even placed on top of one another if necessary, but no "decontamination" of gloves is permitted. The optimal solution is
