# 11057 - Exact Sum

Peter received money from his parents this week and wants to spend it all buying books. But he does not read a book so fast, because he likes to enjoy every single word while he is reading. In this way, it takes him a week to finish a book.

As Peter receives money every two weeks, he decided to buy two books, then he can read them until receive more money. As he wishes to spend all the money, he should choose two books whose prices summed up are equal to the money that he has. It is a little bit difficult to find these books, so Peter asks your help to find them.

## Input

Each test case starts with $2 \le N \le 10000$, the number of available books. Next line will have $N$ integers, representing the price of each book, a book costs less than $1000001$. Then there is another line with an integer $M$, representing how much money Peter has. There is a blank line after each test case. The input is terminated by end of file (EOF).

## Output

For each test case you must print the message:  
`Peter should buy books whose prices are i and j.`,  
where $i$ and $j$ are the prices of the books whose sum is equal to $M$ and $i \le j$. You can consider that is always possible to find a solution, if there are multiple solutions print the solution that minimizes the difference between the prices $i$ and $j$. After each test case you must print a blank line.

# 中文翻譯

Peter 這週從父母那裡拿到了零用錢，想把錢全部拿去買書。但他讀書的速度不快，因為他喜歡細細品味每一個字。因此，他需要一週才能讀完一本書。

由於 Peter 每兩週才會拿到一次錢，他決定一次買兩本書，這樣就可以讀到下次領錢為止。因為他希望把錢全部花完，所以他應該選擇兩本書，使它們的價格總和剛好等於他手上的金額。要找到這兩本書有點困難，因此 Peter 請你幫忙。

## 輸入

每筆測資一開始是一個整數 $2 \le N \le 10000$，表示可購買的書本數量。下一行包含 $N$ 個整數，表示每本書的價格，每本書的價格小於 $1000001$。接著有一行包含一個整數 $M$，表示 Peter 擁有的金額。每筆測資後會有一個空白行。輸入以檔案結尾（EOF）結束。

---

## 輸出

對於每筆測資，請輸出以下訊息：

```
Peter should buy books whose prices are i and j.
```

其中 $i$ 與 $j$ 為兩本書的價格，且其總和等於 $M$，並且 $i \le j$。你可以假設一定存在解答。若有多組解，請輸出使 $i$ 與 $j$ 差值最小的那一組。每筆測資輸出後請再輸出一個空白行。
